lets focus on stability, there are many inputs that cause the app to crash. for example if the horn width is 500 and i want to enter 150, when deleting the 500 the app crashed, if highlighting the whole number instead and typing 1 for 150 the app also crashes. lets improve the UX so the user can enter numbers without crashing the app. check all inputs for this and come up with a clean UX for the side nav.

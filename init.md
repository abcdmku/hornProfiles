create a 2d profile genereator for loudspeaker horns. i want a standard library that can be extended. each profile should be contained in its own file which defines a function that generates an xy plot of points, default values for the input, and a set of values the user can modify. I want to start off with conical, exponetial, tractrix, spherical. do a deep dive in greating the correct profiles. everything should use typescript. refer to the claude.md for standard practices.s

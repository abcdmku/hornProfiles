 the bolt holes are not meshed correctly on either mount they points are not connecting on the correct side. also the driver mount does not connect the correct points to the throat see examples/issue/image.png for the issue, i marked in red where the throat is. nothing should cross the inside throat. same with the bolt holes, no lines should cross inside the bolt holes. ensure bolt holes always work and research the correct way to do this.
